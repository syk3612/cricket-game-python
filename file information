This program uses functions to divide the game into small reusable parts, such as playing one innings and controlling the overall match. It uses variables to store values like the current score and the player’s choice. A loop is used to keep the game running repeatedly until a stopping condition is met, such as a player getting out or crossing the target. Conditional statements (if) are used to check rules, for example validating input, deciding when a player is out, determining whose turn it is, and announcing the winner. The random module is used so the computer can generate a random number between 1 and 6, similar to rolling a dice. User input allows the player to interact with the game by choosing bat or bowl and entering runs, while print statements display the game progress and results. Finally, the program uses a main control block to start execution in a structured way and ensure the game runs only when the file is executed directly.
